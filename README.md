# Canada growing degree days (GDD) data visualization

This project was done for course CMSC6950 at MUN in Spring 2016. The original project repository is available at: https://github.com/GrowingDegreeDay/Project1

I was a team member and did the interactive plots of this project which include the following files: "acc_gdd_plot.py", "min_max_gdd_plot.py", "min_max_plot.py".

# To run interactive plots: 
You need to install all dependencies (Anaconda package recommended) and run "bokeh serve acc_gdd_plot.py" on the "\src" folder command line.
